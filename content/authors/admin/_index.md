bio: My research interests lies in designing, developing and evaluating
  interactive AI systems, in particular involving Natural Language Processing. I
  apply user research methods to understand how users interact with AI to create
  digital artifacts. As part of my research, I build interactive systems to
  support people explore and control the generative capabilities of new AI
  systems.

I am a last-year undergraduate student at the University of Bayreuth (Germany). I am advised by Dr. Daniel Buschek working as a student researcher at the Research Group HCI + AI. Currently, I am working on creating data physicalizations with everyday objects together with Prof. David Lindlbauer (*[Augmented Perception Lab](https://augmented-perception.org/)*) and Dr. Dominik Moritz (*[Data Interaction Group](https://dig.cmu.edu/)*) at Carnegie Mellon University.
