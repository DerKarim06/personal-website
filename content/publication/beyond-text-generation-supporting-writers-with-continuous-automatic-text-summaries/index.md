abstract: We propose a text editor to help users plan, structure and reflect on
  their writing process. It provides continuously updated paragraph-wise
  summaries as margin annotations, using automatic text summarization. Summary
  levels range from full text, to selected (central) sentences, down to a
  collection of keywords. To understand how users interact with this system
  during writing, we conducted two user studies (N=4 and N=8) in which people
  wrote analytic essays about a given topic and article. As a key finding, the
  summaries gave users an external perspective on their writing and helped them
  to revise the content and scope of their drafted paragraphs. People further
  used the tool to quickly gain an overview of the text and developed strategies
  to integrate insights from the automated summaries. More broadly, this work
  explores and highlights the value of designing AI tools for writers, with
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities that go beyond direct text
  generation and correction.
