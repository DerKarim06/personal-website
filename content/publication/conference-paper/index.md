abstract: We present SummaryLens, a concept and prototype for a mobile tool that
  leverages automated text summarization to enable users to quickly scan and
  summarize physical text documents. We further combine this with a
  text-to-speech system to read out the summary on demand. With this concept, we
  propose and explore a concrete application case of bringing ongoing progress
  in AI and Natural Language Processing to a broad audience with interactive use
  cases in everyday life. Based on our implemented features, we describe a set
  of potential usage scenarios and benefits, including support for low-vision,
  low-literate and dyslexic users. A first usability study shows that the
  interactive use of automated text summarization in everyday life has
  noteworthy potential. We make the prototype available as an open-source
  project to facilitate further research on such tools.
